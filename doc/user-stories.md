User Story:

Dylan-

The main user are low stakes online poker players in heads-up games. They want to use our software to help decide
actions and bet amounts according to current hands and the opponents actions and bets during each round of play. They 
would want to be able to input current hand of both themselves and the opponent, as well as the cards on the board, and
bet sizes. Their skill level is not technical and would need a simple UI as well as input method.
